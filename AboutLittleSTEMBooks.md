      <h2>Tell me more about <span>little</span>STEM Books</h2>
      <p>About littleSTEM Books:
We are a publisher of picture books that show girls as the main characters in stories with science, technology, engineering, and math themes. 
Our target audience is girls from 4-9 years old, with an emphasis on girls from underrepresented minority groups.
We want to promote reading, and STEM at the same time, while also giving girls a way to see representation of themselves

    </p>

    <p>What We Want
  How we will use the money:
We will use the money to commission art and pay for production and distribution costs for e-books and physical books for our stories. 

The goal is to raise funding and give as many books away as possible to schools, after-school programs, and nonprofits like The Girls Scouts of America and Girls Inc.

For real though… how will this actually make your community more awesome?:
Girls are half the population, so anything we can do to break down stereotypes and to encourage girls to take up careers in science and technology is a positive and awesome thing.

We'll be happy when there are as many girls in STEM books as princess books, with a true diversity of girls portrayed as the leads in their own stories.
It take a lot to move the equilibrium from where it is now, with no corporate backing, only the support of individuals. 

The goal is to get to a sustainable nonprofit that can have a whole portfolio of books out there and let the GIRLS CHOOSE which ones they like the best.

We envision using donations by regular people to be able to offer these books for free to other nonprofits, so that when they have girls in stem type programs, they will also have material that shows stories and encourage the visualization of someone who looks like them doing science things!!!

In 20 years I want a whole cohort of girls and boys to have had such a mix of media impressions that they've grown up with the thought of girls interested and involved and working i. science and technology careers as no big deal.

That is the legacy I want for this organization

I want this idea to have been so big and obvious  that all the media conglomerates jump on the bandwagon
I want their market research people to say hey, we have to make a movie showing female characters as hackers and makers and electrical engineers and chemists and theoretical physicists because everyone else is making them and we don't want to miss the boat.

I also don't want this to just be about our team creating stuff.
I'd like to involve high school or college students with mini workshops, take kids who have an interest in science or who are studying science to story-fy their interests as a way of encouraging the kids behind them. Reach back and share their passions and interests with the little kids.
The act of creation of a story, of combining the left and right brain will make them better science communicators if they continue to pursue science.


    </p>
<p>    
As background, girls go into elementary school with the same interest levels as boys in STEM, but by the beginning of middle school the well documented divide has already started. Girls are constantly given messaging from our society that STEM fields are for boys and that girls are unwelcome and unfit for the sciences. Research shows that the media we all consume is at least partly to blame with limited representation of female scientists in movies and other media.
</p>

<p>Most kids do not know somebody who works in a STEM field.
So how are they going to get interested in a field where none of the images they see look like them, and they don't know anyone who does it?

STEM practitioners in the media are male by default, sending a clear message to half of the population.

By creating a series of children’s books that follow their characters’ interests in astronomy, robotics, marine life, and a host of other topics, we can present STEM subjects to girls as viable career goals and options in an entertaining way. Further, by drawing girls of different ethnicities as the main characters in different series, we can show a wide audience of girls someone who looks like them and who takes an interest in science and the world around them. We therefore will use picture book stories to model the kind of world we want our girls to live in, the world of the future where tech is as natural and necessary as the air we breathe.

As far as we know, there is no other effort anywhere in the world that specifically attacks the problem of getting more girls involved with STEM through picture book stories. We see our books as a potential counterbalance to the message that society gives young children about who can be good at science and technology. 

We want our books to show girls they belong in science and technology, too.
</p>
<p>If you are in a group that is underrepresented in tech, the equilibrium point is to stay underrepresented in the future.

So that's where the equilibrium is.
We are there right now.

<p>What Motivates Me as the Founder
What motivates me?
Age, approaching 46/47
Leaving a legacy
Leaving a world that is better for my own kids and my 20+ nieces than the one I grew up in.

Think about it before, 
Something that you are really passionate about. Something you think somebody should do.
Then, look around to see if anybody is doing it.
If not you're up!
So we are up, now. 
This is a good idea. Need help to make it fly.


As my wife put it one day a few weeks ago, I want this organization to boil the ocean!
Is that asking too much, is it??

</p>
<p>Two experiments to illustrate our point:
1The Draw A Scientist Test
2Find Female Characters in Science
But now, move out of the general universe of media, to stuff with science and tech themes.
Think of some books or movies or cartoons with female characters who are scientists, engineers, chemists, software engineers, hackers, makers, etc. 
tech background or doing tech things

Have you got any?
Take a 30 secs moment and write down a list!
Don't cheat off of your neighbors!

And now, get rid of all the sidekicks!
Every character who is a sidekick to the main character, cross it off. Even if you love the character, or the series.
Cross it off.
</p>


      <p>There is a hole in bookstore shelves online and IRL.
It is obvious, so obvious that it was like the air, I didn't really see it for a long time.
Now that we've seen it, it cannot be unseen.
And that is why we are here.
Anyone know what hole I am talking about?
Early elementary school data shows girls and boys are equally likely to be engaged by stem.

By middle school, high school, and college this is clearly no longer true!

So, what kind of influences could possibly be weighing down girls from looking at science and tech careers as goals and options.
</p>
<p>Flashing slide : THE MEDIA they consume.
I am going to concentrate of kids books, and what we need your help to do in this part I the market.

No one at any media company has ever been fired for suggesting a white male hero for a book/movie/cartoon. Anywhere!

This is true universally. I don't even have to be talking about tech for this to be true.

But now, move out of the general universe of media, to stuff with science and tech themes.
Think of some books or movies or cartoons with female characters who are scientists, engineers, chemists, software engineers, hackers, makers, etc.

<p>So now, we are at the story of how this org got started.

It started from my own personal annoyance!!!!
After the fact, people have told me that lots of good nonprofits and for profits have started thy way, so I hope that bodes well for us.

In Nov 2012, I was looking for a b'day present for my sister's daughter, who was turning six.

So I went on Amazon and true to find a picture book with a girl main character and science theme.
Surprise! I spent a lot of time on Amazon, and walking thru Barnes and Nobles, and I even went to the comic store Forbidden Planet. I only came across a few titles. (These are mainstream places, I know!)
Lots of boy protagonists in this space, mostly from movie franchises like transformers, Star Wars, etc.
But few girls characters at all, and certainly no girl protagonists.

Then I started looking for princesses!!!
How many princess books can kids really consume? It is like eating too much of one type of candy, you have to get sick eventually.
</p>
<p>But no one ever got fired from a media company for suggesting another princess book, right?

My first thought was it’s a wonder that there are any girls who choose to be in tech at the beginning of the pipeline at all!

Most kids do not know somebody who works in a STEM field.
So how are they going to get interested in a field where none of the images they see look like them, and they don't know anyone who does it?

I started doing anecdotal surveys of women I met of various ages. Women say 50+, it always seemed like there was always a family member in tech, father, grandfather, sometimes mother.

But if you are in a group that is underrepresented in tech, this seems to suggest that the equilibrium point is for that group to stay underrepresented in the future.

So that's where the equilibrium is.
We are there right now.

What about people who had no family in tech, how did they get into it?

It was always something they saw on tv, or read, or it was someone they met.

I am not saying anything revolutionary! 
But what this does mean if we, collectively, can get off of this equilibrium point, the same lament is going to exist 20 years from now</p>

<p>ABOUT ME: WHY DO THIS?
Leaving a legacy
Leaving a world that is better for my own kids and my 20+ nieces than the one I grew up in.
B/C I can. I have the skill to write some of the books myself.
</p>

<p>Mission Statement

The audience for this project is children from 0-8 years old , and girls in this age group specifically. Picture books with girls as the main characters overwhelmingly show them as princesses. 
We want our project to show non-princess main characters who excel at and who love science and math. 

Our goals are to:
1) show girls positive images of girls engaged with science and math themes so they see STEM careers as goals and options,
2) show some of the most interesting ideas researcher are working on right now, and translate them into kid friendly form.
3) rely heavily on images to tell the best stories about the kinds of things that interest scientists
4) create fun picture books with compelling stories that both kids and adults will love to read.
